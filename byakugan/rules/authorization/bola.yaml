vulnerability:
  id: BYAKUGAN-BOLA-001
  name: "Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA)"
  description: >
    BOLA/IDOR occurs when an application fails to properly verify that the user
    has access to the requested object. This rule tests for unauthorized access
    to resources by manipulating object references.
  remediation: >
    - Implement proper authorization checks for each object access
    - Use indirect object references (GUID instead of sequential IDs)
    - Validate user permissions against accessed objects
    - Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
